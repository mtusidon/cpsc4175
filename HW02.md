**1. What is the first step in creating a piece of software?**

 _Determining the requirements if the first step. Knowing what to make before trying to make it is key._

**2. What is the difference in discovering what the client needs and discovering what the software should do?**

_The client may not know how specifically the commissioned software may work or have knowledge of the codebase. If a client adjusts their requirements, the software may have to drastically change, or barely at all._

**3. In what sense is a software engineer a generalist rather than a specialist?**

_A software engineer does not spend all of their time creating as a typical engineer would. They have managerial duties as well as development ones. _

**4. List some techniques the book identifies as useful for determining requirements, and for each, give a reason why that technique might not be effective.**

_Interviewing: This method may not be effective because it requires physical presence and availability._ 

_Questionaire: This method takes much time and logistics, as gathering and validating each individual survey to ensure data quality is the whole point._

_Direct Observation of Users: This method also takes a large amount of time, as someone has to analyze the footage to exactly surmise what requirements would be needed. Discovery of requirements is also not guaranteed._ 

**5. In what sense are requirements dynamic rather than static?**

_As software is maintained, more features are typically added if users still use it. Therefore, improving the software is an incentive for keeping the userbase and requirements will change along with it._

**6. In your own words, state the difference between functional and nonfunctional requirements. Do you think that there is any such thing as a "nonfunctional" requirement?**

_A functional requirement is a requirement that is mandatory and defines the purpose of the product, and a nonfunctional requirement is something that isn't necessary for the software to do its job. A nonfunctional requirement may be the feature that allows the user to change fonts._

**7. What is _top-down analysis_? You may also see this referred to as _structured analysis_. How is this different than the case study in chapter 11 in the book?** 

_Structured analysis is a rigid, multi-step method to put requirements on paper in the scheme of a data flow diagram._

_The case study does not list all of the needs at once in the DFD, but comes up with requirements as time progresses._

**8. _Prototyping_ is a very  controversial issue. Can you think of some reasons why many software engineers think that prototyping is harmful?**

_Prototyping is intendeded to show functuality and usable software as quickly as possible. This is at the expense of taking more time to design the software without coding a working release. Thus, performance issues may plague prototyping, as there is no time for optimization._

**9. Teams One and Two both have the responsibility for developing a software requirements specification for a project. Team One has infrequent changes to its requirements specification, while Team Two has very frequent changes to its requirements specification. Which team is doing the better job? Justify your answer.**

_If Team Two is only adding more and more ideas to their SRS instead of spending as much time building, they may get started too late. In this case, Team One may be better off._

**10. More software defects are traceable to bad requirements analysis than to any other source. Why do you think this is ture?**

_Analysis ensures that the requirements are sound and free of conflict or contradictions. The framework of software determines the backbone of the underlying code, so inherently flawed design will more easily produce bugs._
