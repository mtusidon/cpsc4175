# Homework 10

__1. In building a software product, the book identifies two kinds of planning that must occur. Name the
two types and give two examples of each.__
_The planning that happens throughout the whole project and the planning that occurs after the completion of the specification. Two examples of the whole project planning may include planning the requirements or which type of testing (white/black box). Two examples of the latter include planning which coding standards to use or estimating the cost of the project._

__2. What does figure 9.1 tell you about the range of cost estimates during the various workflows of a
software project? Be specific as to the percentage of uncertainty at each of the four workflows shown
on the X axis of the chart.__
_The cost estimate range before the requirements workflow is 4, before analysis is 2.5, before design is 1.5, and before implementation is close to 1. The figure tells me that the range of cost estimates decreases exponentially as the project becomes more tangible and fleshed out._

__3. The book identifies two different kinds of costs associated with building a software product. Identify
the two kinds of costs, and for each give two examples.__
_The two costs are internal and external. The internal costs can include developer salaries, hardware used to develop the software. The external costs can include the client's pay for the project, and underselling to secure a client._

__4. The book lists six reasons why the LOC (lines of code) metric may not be satisfactory. List four
of them and for each, give an example (preferably from your own personal experience) showing the
problematic nature of that reason.__
_Creation of source code is not reflective of work outside of the implementation workflow:
There can be much planning and testing that goes behind the final source code, and the final product may end up with fewer lines as a result.
Different languages can produce different amount of lines for the same function:
Some languages are designed in a way to write compact code blocks, and other languages may have boilerplate code that is not unique to the function. 
The weights may not be the same for each lien of code: Definitions, declarations, comments may not be as weighted as the lines more essential to the execution of the functions.
Not all code may be essential to the product: Some of the code may just be there for interactions with separate software only used during the development process._

__5. The function point metric is widely used. Do some independent research on function point analysis/-
function point estimation and write a brief summary of your research. In particular, Does there seem
to be a widely accepted formula for function point estimation?__
_Function points are used to measure the usability of a information system as a user product. The metric itself is called a function size measurement, also used to measure the financial and labor costs of a project. There is no less than 5 standards for function point analysis, and each of these different systems value different aspects of function points. So far, there is no function point standard that measures algorithmic complexity._

__6. The book references IEEE-158. This standard has been superseded by IEEE-16326. I have placed a
copy of IEEE-16326 in the SWE directory of my Github repository for CPSC-4175. Select one major
subsection of subsection 5 (Elements of the project management plan) and write a brief discussion of
that major subsection. Choose whatever item interests you.__
_The section I have chosen is the process improvement plan. This sublcause references the life cycle model management process, and details regarding how to improve each aspect of the software engineering cycle. Disruption risks are identified and factor into the decision on whether or not to alter the current model._

__7. The book notes that, for every 100 hours developers spent on implementation, they spent 150 hours on
activities related to documentation. Give some thought to your project in this class, and state some
practices and/or guidelines you may adopt in an effort to generate appropriate documentation for your
project. As you will discover when you work as a developer, in many cases, a failure to document your
efforts is tantamount to a failure to complete the project.__
_I find that the best level of documentation is moderate. Too little documentation and maintenance will be a nightmare, and too much documentation will bloat maintenance time. Documentation proves that the developer believes in their code. Each vital function should be explained in detail, and if there is code that has much nesting, the code should be traced with the comments._

__8. Why do you think a user would conclude that you did not write a piece of software if you did not
document the software?__
_With all software projects, especially ones with large codebases, a developer needs documentation to refer to all throughout the project. Documentation allows a developer to save time and effort, and have proof that they are following the SRS requirements.
