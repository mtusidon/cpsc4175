__1. What do you think is the difference between an aspect in the aspect oriented development model and
a class in an object oriented development model? Be specific.__
_Aspects are unlike classes in that when something is added to a class, all other dependencies must be accounted for where this class is instantiated or called. Aspects, however, offer a cutoff point for code that it does not need to touch. Aspects are much appreciated when one does not wish to update every method in a class._

__2. Consider the problem of targeting software to a particular platform, e.g. a handheld device as opposd
to a desktop computer. Describe the differences between addressing this problem in the design phase(s)
of the engineering process and the analysis phase(s) of the engineering process.__
_In the design phase, a rough sketch can be made to highlight the differences between platforms. The more obvious differences will arise quickly, and a topdown approach can be used. In the analysis phase, more specialization will be needed. This can come in the form of experts in the hardware and underlying operating systems of the different platforms.

__3. (Not in book) The Universal Windows Platform (UWP) is one major effort to solve the problem of
deploying software to different platforms. Research the UWP, and briefly describe its approach to
solving this problem.__
_UWP uses a native Windows API called Windows Runtime that has support for most of the popular languages in use. Templates are given for each language to follow, and a standard packaging feature is offered, along with a universal deployment to the Windows Store. Windows devices have a common API, and this feature allows for support for virtually all windows devices for all Windows software.

__4. How does a point-and-click IDE (such as Visual Studio) promote component based design? What do
you think the benefits of component based design are? What are its costs?__
_Point-and-click IDE's promote component based design by providing a visual organization of the codebases and files. The benefits are that many sections of the project can be delegated to different people, and allow for larger staff sizes and increase productivity. The costs come with merging and packaging the different components._

__5. Describe infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), platform-as-a-service (PaaS), and software-as-a-service (SaaS).
What are the differences between them? What are the similarities?__
_These are all cloud services. IaaS provides resources such as servers and other hardware, PaaS offers computing platforms such as databases and coding environments, and SaaS offers solely software such as email and word processors._

__6. The Semantic Web incorporates the concept of marking up information, as opposed to marking up
structure (HTML) and presentation (CSS). This is commonly done with XML. Create a document
marking up the information contained in a fast food menu (hamburgers, tacos, pizza, sandwiches,
etc.). Your document should contain about ten or twelve different items.__
_File enclosed in directory_

__7. Discuss one specific technique you can use in your personal software development process that addresses
the concerns of software security. “Discuss” includes describing the technique, explaining how
it promotes security, and giving a concrete example.__
_Always using try/catch blocks for exception handling. This prevents an error from crashing the software and leading to attackers to abusing this vulnerability to create downtime. An example would include using try/catch blocks instead of if statements. Try/catch blocks will always capture exceptions, and if coded properly, will prevent the crash of software.

__8. Read the article by E. F. Codd entitled A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks, in
the PDF directory in my class Github repository as codd.pdf. Write a one paragraph appreciation of
this article.__
