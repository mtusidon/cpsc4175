# Homework 6
## Joseph Kim
__1. Consider the programming languages you may have studied and their differences. Think of two problem domains you would use for each language. For each problem domain, explain why your choice of the other language would be a poorer choice for an implementation language.__

Two problem domains would be compatibility of the architecture of the hardware, and performance requested by the client. For C++, the architecture of the hardware is a significant problem domain as it is a low-level language and interacts intimately with low level components. If combability across many platforms is desired, Java would be a better choice as the JVM ensures software will run on nearly any platform. However, if the problem domain were performance, C++ would be the better option because of the fact it is low-level; because of the JVM acting as an additional layer between the source code and hardware, Java would not have as high performance.

__2. Give some concrete counter-examples of good programming practices as discussed in the book. These include meaningful variable names, self-documenting code, symbolic constants, and code layout. In other words, give examples of what not to do.__
 
Too-descriptive variables can cause code bloat and impact readability, self-documenting code can also bloat code and bog down maintenance. Too many symbolic constants can hamstring any future attempts at code maintenance as more time will be spent flipping back to reference them. Code layout can waste time if too much importance is placed on it, as more time will be spent on formatting rather than coding.

__3. Give two versions of coding standards for subprocedure blocks. This may require an internet search. Which do you prefer, and why?__

Visual basic requires subprocedures to follow the format of [ modifiers ] Sub subname [( parameterlist )]
Java requires the same standards as normal procedures, but must implement a Callable interface.
I prefer the Java standard as there isn’t much more to coding a subprocedure than a regular procedure, and the use of an interface for more specific functions is a great addition.

__4. An informal description of the DRY principle is this: “The second time you write exactly the same code, stop what you are doing and place that functionality in a subprocedure. Then, invoke the subprocedure whenever you need that functionality.” Give one example of this from your previous programming experience. If you have never experienced this in practice, make up an example.__

When I was first writing in Java I was creating a menu of choices and one choice would bring up more choices again. I rewrote the menu function to invoke a “nested choice” function if I needed that functionality again.

__5. What is a stub? What is a driver? Have you ever used stubs or drivers in your previous programming experience? If so, give an example. If not, consider a function that takes a unit price, a sales tax rate, and the quantity ordered, and write a stub (using pseudo code or a language of your choice) that takes these three arguments and returns a value.__

A stub is “dummy function” that provides input values for another finished function for testing. A driver is another “dummy function” that tests inputs provided from another finished function. I have used stubs when testing an ATM program in a previous class, and used a driver when testing an item generator in another previous class.

__6. List two strengths and one weakness of top down integration.__

Two strengths are knowledge of exactly how the finished integration is designed, and consequently fewer faults. One weakness is loss of time spent designing the integration all at once first.


__7. List two strengths and one weakness of bottom up integration.__

Two strengths are rapid development and less time spent on planning. One weakness is potentially more faults being produced than if top down integration were implemented instead.

__8. This is not in the book and will require some independent research. A domain specific language *DSL) is a small, incomplete language typically used as a “glue” language between a lower level language (like C) and a higher-level language (like Python.) An example of a DSL might be a helper language for HTML, e.g. div(…)  might resolve to <div> …</div>. How might a DSL promote what the book calls sandwich integration? This is not a trick question but it will require some thought. If you work as a developer, you will eventually write your own DSLs for various purposes.__

DSL would promote sandwich integration, as it helps documentation for the final round of testing interfaces between the two different languages. Because more familiar syntax is used as the result of choosing to use DSL, development times would be shortened and less time would be spent “translating” code from one language to another.

__9. What is the difference in testing carried out by the implementation group and the testing carried out by the SQA group?__

Testing done by the implementation group may be less thorough as they will be spending more time on developing than testing. The role of SQA is to catch all potential faults that remain, so their testing is more thorough.

__10. Read the letter by Edgar Dijkstra to the Communications of the ACM (in the PDF directory as dijkstra68.pdf) and write a one paragraph appreciation of this letter.
__

Edgar Dijkstra greatly dislikes the GO TO statement, and for good reason. In his critique, he declares that it is one of the biggest causes of sloppy and illogical programming. He recommends substitutes that would more logically follow the flow of code, such as simply incrementing a counter when trying to find indices for a dynamically increasing array. I agree with his reasoning, as he says that the job of a programmer is not finished when his program is finished. He or she must consider the program as it’s running since he or she has long written it. Scope must make sense within its context, and the use of GO TO statements and similar, lazy shortcuts are ultimately detrimental to writing good, functional code.
