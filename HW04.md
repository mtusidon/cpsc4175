**1. What is an entity class? A boundary class? A control class?**
An entity class models information that stays for the duration of the software. A boundary class models the input and output. A control class models the engine and algorithms of the software.	

**2. Write a use case pertaining to your project.** 
A player interacts with the GUI class, the GUI class queries the game state class, the game state class uses the game engine class, and the game state class updates the GUI. The cycle then repeats. 

**3. Write a successful scenario pertaining to your project.**
A player interacts with the GUI to place a game piece on the board, the game state and game engine classes properly parse the input, and the output is successfully updated on the GUI.

**4. Write an unsuccessful scenario pertaining to your project.**
A player interacts with the GUI to place a game piece on the board, the game state throws an exception and the game crashes.

**5. Using your answers to the three previous questions, use the noun extraction method to extract the classes. If practicable, identify the classes you extract as entity, boundary, and control classes. If all your classes are entity classes, you will not be able to do this.**
The player is the entity class, the GUI is the boundary class, and the game engine and game state classes are control classes.

**6. Using your answer to the previous question, draw an appropriate class diagram.**
