__The Magic Cauldron__

_Open source projects do indeed seem like products of magic; a project that seemingly materializes out of thin air through the efforts of many, without compensation. Where is the motivation for all of this sweat and blood? Eric Steven Raymond breaks down this mystery in this paper._

_Established first is the value of a software, through its use and sale price. Use value is determined by how much productivity it increases through its use, and sale price is its currency value for use. Old-fashioned metrics are often used to mark a value on software, like a physical item such as lumber. The author argues that this is done by measuring the cost by developer salary and usability._

_The author then argues against this model for determining the cost of developing software. Code is typically written nowadays to suit the needs of the client, and for that specialization, the code has to be written "in-house" and copying the code itself does not transfer 100% of the usability to the copier. Code is written around its environment, and environments change everywhere. Thus, most code writing isn't new code, but maintainence. Maintainence has little value in being copied and used in a different environment._

_With this rationale in mind, most of the value from software doesn't come straight from usability, but from continued support and maintainence. And here lies the value of open-source software. Virtually infinite users can offer feedback, which means a rigorous development and robust process._

_So with open-source software and its enormous userbase, the quality of software rises, and thus customers will actually use the software. The profit immediately follows afterwards. Buying software is an archaic model, and more creative ways of monetizing open-source software can be made. Advertisements and donations are just few and simple examples._


__In the Beginning was the Command Line__

_The origin of the operating system is a disruptive one. The first personal computers were a strange idea, as a machine in the home for just "processing information" was a vague idea. However, it took off, along with the idea of buying "software". Microsoft released OS's on a disk, but people learned quickly and saw the usefulness of software that delegated other software for the layman and enthusiast alike. The first analogies that were made about early OS's were vehicles. MS-DOS was a "three-speed bicycle". Primitive, yet easily tinkered with. Windows 95 would be harkened as a station wagon. Then came Linux, which is hilariously labeled a tank that enthusiasts in tents were building._

_The author goes on to reminese about the olden days of written code on paper, debugging by brain and pencil, then actually "programming" a computer to run it when access to one was available. Nowadays, abstraction is much higher and telling a story of "computer programming" of the old days creates reactions akin to visiting cavemen in a natural history museum._

_GUI's are taken much for granted in today's world. Command lines were commonplace before the introduction of the first GUI, and the Macintosh OS was that OS. It did not have a command line, because the business decided that its customers do not need one with its GUI. Thus the idea was that the natural progression of computing was going from the command line to the GUI, and the command line was just another thing that happened to go obsolete. However, this of course is not true today._

_The command line sees much use today, especially in Linux systems. Even without the comfort of a GUI to visually represent directories, the command line still offers uncluttered power and control of a system. Even with its learning curve, mastery of the command line is still a crucial skill in today's world, when maximum productivity is needed._
