#Homework #5

**1. What are the two basic ways of designing a product? Explain what they are and how they differ.**
Operation-oriented design and data-oriented design. Operation-oriented design is emphasis on operations, data-oriented places the emphasis on data. They differ because they both neglect the secondary aspect, which object-oriented design fixes; it focuses equally on operations AND data.

**2. What are the inputs and the outputs to the design workflow, according to the book? Briefly explain why the particular inputs are important and how they impact design. Briefly explain how the particular outputs are important and how they influence design.** The “highest points of abstraction” for both input and output is when the input or output starts losing its identity and thus the threshold for when the next module be identified and start.

**3. Traditionally, a computer program was seen as a data processing application. Variables were divided into three categories: input variables, output variables, and processing variables. The book describes a design process based on this paradigm that is recursive. Explain in detail how you would design a student’s graduation requirements in terms of input variables, output variables and processing variables. This is not asking for a design, but just identification of variables you might want to create and where in the design you would place them.**
The input variables would be the Student ID, Student Transcript, and Major. The processing variables would be Major Course Requirements, GPA Requirements. The output variable would be Remaining Courses.

**4. Perform a transaction analysis for the graduation requirements problem you used for the previous question. Your answer should be a sequential list of subprodecdures you would design to solve the problem. Notice that the previous question called for what was, in essence, a list of nouns, while this question calls for, in essence, a list of verbs.**
determine\_major, determine\_eligible\_courses, determine\_remaining\_courses

**5. Object-oriented analysis and design conceptually is seen as a grouping of objects, instantiated from classes. Classes encapsulate both states (variables, nouns) and behavior (subprocedures, verbs). Based on your answers to the two previous questions, describe one class that might be appropriate for a graduation requirements application. Identify the attributes (properties) and behaviors (methods) this class might contain.**
The attributes this class would have are studentID, studentTranscript, studentMajor, majorCourseRequirements, and gpaRequirements. The methods would be getMajor(), getEligibleCourses(), getRemainingCourses().

**6. As discussed in the book, the design workflow can be considered an iterative, spiral process in itself. As we have been discussing in class, the design phase can be seen as part of an iterative that also includes analysis, implementation, and testing phases. The answer to this question obviously depends on the nature of the software under development, so there is no one correct answer to this question. Here is the question: Consider the software project you are working on for this class, and briefly state which view you think is more appropriate to your work. Justify your answer by making a reasonable argument as to why you answered this question the way you did.** 
For our project, a strategy game, an iterative process is appropriate. Many design changes have occurred due to arising problems with previous design implementations. For example, our game board design was initially going to record pieces in a hashmap of coordinates, but was changed to objects with multiple pointers instead due to more specificity required.

**7. What is the difference between testing an implementation and testing a design? Write a procedure for testing the design of the student graduation requirements problem in the questions above. Define a procedure for one of the following: either a data analysis design, a transaction analysis design, or an object-oriented design.** Implementation testing involves a more concrete system to literally test and try to break. Changes are more specific and can be directly written in code. Testing a design is purely conceptional and lacks the more specific testing that implementation testing can achieve. For testing the graduation requirements implementation: Try all manner of inputs to perfect input sanitation, Check null cases, check that proper outputs are generated. For object-oriented design: Check that the proper variables would be protected/private, Check that all exceptions are properly handled, Check that all attributes and methods are properly encapsulated.

**8. What is the cyclomatic complexity of Figure 1? Explain your answer.**

M = E - N + 2P

M = 11 – 10 + 2(1)

M = 3
