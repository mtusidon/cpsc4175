# Homework 7

__1. Where, in the software construction process, should testing occur? Explain your reasoning.__

Testing should not be in a separate phase of its own, but  should happen throughout the entire software 
engineering process. It should happen during the requirements, analysis, production, and design workflow. This is to reduce the amount of faults throughout the whole software construction process.

__2. Explain the differences and similarities between verification and validation.__ 
Verification and validation both work to prove that something is "true". Verification is the process of 
checking that software meets specifications, and validation is the process of checking that the specification meets the client's needs.

__3. Explain the difference between execution-based-testing and non-execution-based-testing.__

Execution based testing pits the software against test cases, falling within black or white box testing. Non execution based testing is mostly analysis by the actual developers, utilized to detect faults earlier within the software development process.

__4. Discuss the concept of quality as that word is used in the phrase “software quality assurance.”__

Quality is the extent to which the software meets specifications. Additionally, the product must also be well designed and easily read and maintainable.

__5. Why should software not be tested by the implementors, and not implemented by the testers? Think of an illustration from your life experience (not necessarily IT related).__

A chef should not handle complaints from the diners, and a server should not be creating the recipes. An
implementor and tester have different perspectives, and these unique viewpoints work best when their 
respective tasks are delegated instead of combined.

__6. Explain the difference between correctness proofs and execution testing? Which is “better?” Why?__

Correctness proofs mathematically prove that an algorithm will be fault-proof, and execution testing is more practical and involves real software and hardware. Ideally using correctness proofs will theoretically prevent virtually all software side faults, but execution testing is necessary as some scenarios can only be tested in real world circumstances. 

__7. Read the article The Coming Software Apocalypse in the PDF directory. Wrote a one paragraph
appreciation of the article.__

Many aspects of our life have had programming breathed into them. With Moore's Law and advances in computing power, various tasks have been delegated to computers, and in turn programmers. Programming is now an extremely powerful tool, becoming more accessible to laymen every day as scientists and hobbyists use it to automate their own mundane, low-tech needs. As a consequence, this tool has wreaked its havoc society with outages, costing human lives and profits. Testing is now much more abstract and scary, as it is less about how much weight will break a bridge and more a comma out of place killing patients. Programmers having their 
fingers in every single type of service imaginable is a scary thought, as they do not have to be knowledgable about medicine dosages or specific heats, and instead write what they think they need to write.

__8. In regard to that article, how do you see your role in addressing the concerns raised in that article?
Do you really think that there will be a “software apocalypse?”__

I will play part in this apocalypse. And there is no question of if, but when it will happen. With the emergence of the internet of things, all it will take is one type error to poison everyone's water supply, set off every nuclear warhead, or cause every car in the world to simultaenously crash into each other.
