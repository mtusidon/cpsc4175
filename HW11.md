__1. Give an informal description or definition of stepwise refinement. Pretend that you are trying to explain
it to your grandmother or a younger brother or sister.__
_Stepwise refinement is drawing the big picture first, then filling in the details. It's like filling a bucket full of the large rocks first, then adding sand. The general functions are first made, then fleshed out once they are all defined.
_

__2. Consider topdown developnent, stepwise refinement. We have now encountered both of these. Traditionally,
software engineering was taught developing programs using the topdown, stepwise refinement
paradigm. (OOAD has replaced this paradigm.) You have probably never developed a program using
that paradigm, but think about the implications of that technique versus OOAD. Discuss several of
the major differences you can think of.__
_With topdown development and stepwise refinement, the project has to have all of its major functions listed and then development can begin. Major changes mid-project are difficult to implement due to this method relying on everything essential designed at the beginning. OOAD can work with major design changes, as it has been built with changing requirements in mind.

__3. Read the article in my PDF directory on Github by Nicklaus Wirth entitled Program Development by
Stepwise Refinement and write a one paragraph appreciation of that article.__
_Many novice developers fall into the trap of determining that the roadmap to becoming a developer involves becoming proficient in one language and guessing that self-discovery is the next step. However, much guesswork and tinkering has been done by predecessors, and the next step should instead be learning the art of refinement. This is demonstrated through the process of developing an all queens chess game. First each step of the program is deconstructed into smaller steps. The format of the code is then established, and kept consistently throughout development. This paper argues that with stepwise refinement, a well designed structured program can overcome design changes if it were truly well designed._

__4. In business school cost benefit analysis goes by the nae due diligence. Following the example in the
book, give a non-technical example of the exercise of due diligence. (“Non-technical” in the sense of a
business or management decision, for example, opening a branch office or expanding a product line.)__
_The easiest part of due diligence is counting up the assets and liabilities in the paperwork. The harder part is when assumptions are made that can't be measured in convenient units. In the book's example, a company wants to give some of its jobs to computers in order to cut costs and improve efficiency. The easy part is measuring the cost of the employees' salaries against the cost of hardware and software for the computers. The hard part is negociating severances, how many customers will contest their computerized bills, and potential cost of system failure. _

__5. Your book gives the following illustration: “suppose that object A contains an invocation of a method
of object B. In this situation, object A cannot be reused without reusing object B as well.” Please
discuss this problem and state a specific solution to the problem that advances separation of concerns.__
_One solution is to redefine object A to include the offending method of object B. This will avoid the need to reference another object just for one method at each call, and is an example of stepwise refinement._

__6. Answer one of the following two questions. Use the analytical tools you have read about in this chapter.
(a) Design a small program and write the pseudo-code that generates documentation from a source file.
Input is a source listing. Output is a formatted documentation document. You documentation
should document all variables by giving the visibility, type, name, and initial value, and all
functions giving the visibility, type, name, and input parameters. You are allowed to require your
source listings to use a particular formatting, similar to Javadoc.
(b) Design a small module and write the pseudo-code that generates four levels of debugging information
while a program is running. You should import, use, or require the module in your program.
Your program should reference the debugging module and initialize a configuration parameter
giving the debugging level. There is no input. Output should be a debugging log. Your output
should include the name of the program and the date on which it was tested. In your program,
you would invoke the debugging module by calling the appropriate debugging functions.__

_a._	

`For each line:`

||`If line contains "class"`

||||`Write(Classname: class)`

||`If line contains "variable"`

||||`Write(Variablename: variable)`

||||||`assign(class)`

||||||`initialValue()`

||`If line contains "function"`

||||`Write(functionname: function)`

||||||`assign(class)`

||||||||`Write(parameters)`

__7. One very common problem, particularly with languages similar to C, is that many files must be compiled
in a specific order because of (among other things) dependencies among files. For example, program.c
may depend on program.h. Make files are almost universally used. Search for a brief makefile example,
and comment on it line by line.__
`foo: main.h foo.o # This line is the dependency.`
||||`gcc -o foo main.h foo.o # This creates the 
association (action).`
`main.h: main.c sum.h # This compiles main to a c 
file`
||||`cc -c main.c # The compile is complete`
`foo.o: foo.c foo.h # This creates the combined dependency and action line.`
||||`gcc -c foo.c # The final compile.`
