__1. What two kinds of things must a software requirements specification contain?__

Functional and NonFunctional Requirements.

__2. Give an example of an ambiuous requirement in English (that is, using a natural language). Explain the ambiguity.__

Storing a user's credentials in a database. This is open to interpretation as what qualifies as credentials isn't explained,
so the table can be disastrously contructed.

__3. Consider the domain of processing student grades. Draw a simple data flow diagram of the process. Create the drawing as a PDF and upload the file to your Github repository. Explain the drawing in English as your answer to this question.__

The domain is the Student, Course, and Section ID Strings, and the Grade decimal. These are all used to generate the Grade Record, which is then pushed into the Transcript Table.

__4. Consider the domain of an online shopping cart. Draw a simple finite state machine of the process.
Create the drawing as a PDF and upload the file to your Github repository. Explain the drawing in
English as your answer to this question.__

The states are Empty, In Cart, Confirmation, and Transaction Completion. These states are so that there is no ambiguity in the entire transaction process. The user can add/remove items and finally confirm or cancel the transaction.

__5. Consider the domain of a database with customer, products, and orders tables. Draw a simple entity-relation
diagram of the database. Create the drawing as a PDF and upload the file to your Github
repository. Give an account of the data structure in English as your answer to this question.__

The entities are Customer, Product, and Order. The relationships are Customer orders Product, Product generates Order.

__6. Consider the project you have chosen as a team. Draw a simple SADT (structured analysis and design
technique) diagram of the project. Create the drawing as a PDF and upload the file to your Github
repository. Explain your project on a high level in English as your answer to this question.__

The GUI takes in the player's command through its parser. The GUI then passes the parse input to the game logic, checking the validity of the command. Then it returns that result to updating the gamestate, which updates the GUI.

__7. This is not in the book. Consider the project you have chosen as a team. Draw a simple SDL
(Specification and Description Language) diagram of the project. Create the drawing as a PDF and
upload the file to your Github repository. Explain your project on a high level in English as your
answer to this question.__

When it is the player's turn, they input their command into the GUI. The game logic checks if it's a valid move, then it either parses the command and updates the gamestate, or it returns an invalid move message. Lastly, the GUI is updated.

__8. Find an image or document online of a simple function using Z. Convert the image or document to a
PDF and upload it to your Github repository. Explain the specification in English as your answer to
this question. Note that the Z language is difficult and takes years to learn. This course is not a course
in Formal Methods, where you might spend an entire semester learning the Z language. You don’t
have to understand the Z specification. All you have to do is have some faint idea about its concept
and operation.__

This Z specification is about a "Withdraw Money" function. The BankAccount object has the attributes  of dollarAmount and centAmount, which are natural numbers. If dollarAmount is less than or equal to dollars, it is implied that centAmoutn is less than or equal to cents. If the centAmount is greater than cents, it is implied that dollars will decrement by 1 less than the dollarAmount, and cents will decrement by 100 more than the centAmount.
